In Discrete-Action-ARS it is possible to have only specific values as possible inserts in Augmented Random Search, this could be used for games or alike, but is here used to show how it works if only specific laser strengths are possible. 

PSO is an implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization, however this was kind of a failed experiment, as it seemed more maluable to random issues. 

Silicon bits is the try to properly implement silicon quantum bits, and try to optimize this system. This however did not seem to work that well, but did show how the system works. Needs more work.
